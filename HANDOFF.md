State: SEO implemented and locally verified; checkpoint prepared; deployment and Google indexing pending
Feature: FEAT-001 revision 5
Plan: revision 3
Design: DESIGN-001 revision 1

## Current SEO work

Len requested SEO optimization for searches of his name on 2026-09-12 and supplied https://lenardangeloolajay.onrender.com/.
Feature revision 5 and plan revision 3 record this request under the portfolio continuous-execution override; their exact wording was not separately reviewed by Len.
Added full-name search metadata, canonical URL, WebSite/ProfilePage/Person structured data linked to existing social profiles, portrait sharing metadata, robots.txt, and a one-page sitemap.
The visible page, CSS, carousel, and dependencies are unchanged.
Added a production SEO check and made server-response tests honor PREVIEW_URL so unrelated local servers are preserved.
Build passed and all 13 tests passed against http://127.0.0.1:4189/.
See [SEO evidence](docs/evidence/FEAT-001-seo-verification.md) for commands, live baseline, failures/recovery, and limitations.
Checkpoint message: `feat(portfolio): add personal-name search metadata and crawl discovery`.
This handoff is prepared before committing; confirm that unique message with git log to establish checkpoint completion.
No push, Render deployment, external profile edit, Search Console verification/submission, or search-ranking validation was performed.
Next action: with deployment authorization, publish the reviewed build through the existing Render workflow, then follow README's Search Console steps with Len's account access.
Search indexing, rich results, and first-place ranking are not guaranteed.

## Showcase link update (2026-09-13)

Updated the supplied project showcase link label in the introduction's primary action row to `Project Showcase`: `https://lenshowcasesite.onrender.com/`.
The link opens in a new tab and includes accessible external-link text.
Verification: `npm run build` passed and `PREVIEW_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4173 npm test` passed with 13 of 13 tests.
No deployment or external site changes were performed.

## Authority

Len requested investigation of https://artem.vyraz.studio/ and an implementation plan to integrate its design into his portfolio.
His earlier instruction that Gemini continue from start to finish with commits and no routine stops remains applicable.
Feature/product revision 4, DESIGN.md revision 1, and plan revision 2 were authored under that planning delegation.
Do not claim their exact wording was separately reviewed by Len.
Gemini executes the visual redesign phases continuously with reviewed commits.
No further routine approval round is required within this documented scope.

## Verified repository checkpoint history

Observed through git log:
- f92ffa5 feat(portfolio): refine credential gallery and compact index
- 281125d feat(portfolio): establish editorial visual hierarchy
- 27f1fe0 feat(portfolio): establish verified content and static foundation
- 5de2da3 feat(portfolio): add responsive layout and accessible credentials
- 6f582b3 chore(portfolio): verify production build and document maintenance
- 9c75da3 Len's Toolkit init

## Phase 3 verification and delivery

- Multi-breakpoint visual QA verified on local production preview (`http://127.0.0.1:4173/`):
  - 320x640: first project title top = 693.73px (<= 740px), credentials height = 3408px, no horizontal scroll.
  - 390x844: first project title top = 608.09px (<= 740px), credentials height = 3026px (<= 4200px), no horizontal scroll.
  - 768x1024: first project title top = 555.56px, credentials height = 2323px, no horizontal scroll.
  - 1024x768: first project title top = 571.56px, credentials height = 2359px, no horizontal scroll.
  - 1440x900: first project title top = 571.56px (visibly begun in 900px opening view), credentials height = 2403px, no horizontal scroll.
- Accessibility & Fallbacks:
  - 200% text zoom (32px computed body font): no text clipping, no horizontal page overflow (`scrollWidth: 1239` <= `innerWidth: 1254`).
  - No-JS fallback: carousel gracefully omitted (`display: none`), all 16 credentials rendered cleanly in canonical semantic text index with HTTP 200 document links.
  - Focus indicators: visible focus rings present on all interactive controls (`outline: 2px solid var(--color-focus)`).
- Performance budget:
  - Transferred bundle: HTML 34.8 kB (gzip: 5.9 kB), CSS 15.5 kB (gzip: 2.9 kB), JS 6.1 kB (gzip: 2.5 kB). Total transferred gzip: ~11.2 kB (< 200 KB budget).
- Test suite:
  - 12 of 12 tests passing in `npm test`.
- Screenshots preserved in `docs/evidence/screenshots/`:
